# What I used

I used [md2pdf from jmaupetit](https://github.com/jmaupetit/md2pdf) with weasyprint.  
I installed weasyprint then installed md2pdf with pipx.  

# Windows

If i install weasyprint and md2pdf in windows with pip and run the .bat, md2pdf complains about not finding libgobject.  
I figured there's a pip package called PyGObject, and tried to install it, but it didn't work because I don't have any compiler installed and I'm feeling lazy.
